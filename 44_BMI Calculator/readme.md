# BMI Calculator

I developed this **BMI Calculator** project to practice my JavaScript skills and learn how to build interactive applications. The BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator allows users to input their weight and height and calculates their BMI, giving a simple indication of their health based on standard categories.
